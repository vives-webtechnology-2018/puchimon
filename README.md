# puchimon
Graphical Puchimon application in the browser

On 22/11/2018 we created classically an application to visualize the Puchimon game. More explanation about the code can be found in [code-explanation.md](code-explanation.md).

The application that was developed, still hase some missing peaces to be fully functional. In this exercise you will try to fill in those missing peaces of code.

## Excercise
